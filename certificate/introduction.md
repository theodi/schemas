This vocabulary is intended to support the publication of machine-readable descriptions of [open data certificates](https://certificates.theodi.org/).

The first version of vocabulary is intentionally small and is intended to support:

* associating a dataset with its certificate, via the `cert:certificate` property
* extracting the answers provided during the certification process, e.g. to support analysis across datasets
* creating new displays of certificate metadata

The vocabulary does not yet support the creation of machine-readable versions of the questionnaire's that are completed during the certification process. This could potentially be added during a later revision.
